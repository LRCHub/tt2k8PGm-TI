[00:10.05] Not tryna be indie
[00:12.38] Not tryna be cool
[00:15.04] Just tryna be in this
[00:17.53] Tell me, are you too?
[00:20.33] Can you feel where the wind is?
[00:23.18] Can you feel it through
[00:25.97] All of the windows
[00:28.54] Inside this room?
[00:37.04] 
[00:31.56] 'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
[00:34.55] And I wanna feel you too
[00:36.94] I wanna see the sun rise on your sins, just me and you
[00:42.20] Light it up, on the run
[00:47.76] Let's make love tonight
[00:52.71] Make it up, fall in love, try
[01:00.77] (Baby, I'm right here)
[01:11.77]

[01:37.67] We were shut like a jacket
[01:40.52] So do your zip
[01:42.99] We would roll down the rapids
[01:45.73] To find a wave that fits
[01:48.42] Can you feel where the wind is?
[01:51.07] Can you feel it through
[01:53.89] All of the windows
[01:56.50] Inside this room?
[02:05.00] 
[01:59.91] 'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
