[00:09.54] Not tryna be indie
[00:12.27] Not tryna be cool
[00:15.16] Just tryna be in this
[00:17.55] Tell me, are you too?
[00:20.23] Can you feel where the wind is?
[00:22.95] Can you feel it through
[00:25.95] All of the windows
[00:28.00] Inside this room?
[00:36.50] 
[00:31.87] 'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
[00:34.67] And I wanna feel you too
[00:37.32] I wanna see the sun rise on your sins, just me and you
[00:42.58] Light it up, on the run
[00:47.75] Let's make love tonight
[00:53.12] Make it up, fall in love, try
[01:00.64] (Baby, I'm right here)
[01:11.64] 
[01:04.92] But you'll never be alone
[01:07.47] I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
[01:10.19] I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
[01:13.19] Baby, I'm right here
[01:15.69] I'll hold you when things go wrong
[01:18.33] I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
[01:21.03] I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
[01:24.09] Baby, I'm right here
[01:31.66] I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
[01:34.64] Baby, I'm right here
[01:44.64] 
[01:37.50] We were shut like a jacket
[01:40.30] So do your zip
[01:42.92] We would roll down the rapids
[01:45.59] To find a wave that fits
[01:48.25] Can you feel where the wind is?
[01:51.02] Can you feel it through
[01:54.01] All of the windows
[01:56.53] Inside this room?
[02:05.03] 
[01:59.89] 'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
[02:02.38] I wanna feel you too
[02:05.25] I wanna see the sun rise on your sins, just me and you
[02:10.44] Light it up, on the run
[02:15.71] Let's make love tonight
[02:21.25] Make it up, fall in love, try
[02:28.60] (Baby, I'm right here)
